INTRODUCTION.

LFD is a decentralized and fair donation token issued by charitable organizations. Two simple public welfare 
mechanisms occur in every transaction: Passive income distribution, LP liquidity fund pool.
LuckyFortuneDog (LFD) is a unique charity community project at present. It combines the charity spirit of the East 
and the West. It will be officially launched in 2021 under the leadership of Gianni Liu. The LFD pass is a fully 
functional and decentralized digital asset built on the Binance Smart Chain (BscScan), with a total issuance of only 
one trillion. LFD has a reward mechanism for each transaction, and it can no longer be changed. Every community 
participant can query the transaction record of LFD on the Blockchain Browser.

Where does LFD come from? 
The idea of LFD originated from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused uncountable families to lose their loved 
ones and many lovely dogs to lose their owners. Amid the catastrophe, a Chinese teenage boy born in Italy 
constructed a shelter and adopted two stray dogs, naming them Lucky and Fortune. The little boy, Gianni Liu, was 
born in December 2006, in the Chinese Year of the Dog. Gianni Liu’s father is a public welfare worker at a local 
charity organization. Affected by his father’s job, Gianni Liu has always been a very optimistic, cheerful kid, keen 
on helping homeless people and stray animals. He has participated in various charitable activities, including charity 
sales and volunteering at hospitals. After hearing about his father’s concern for the risks and challenges faced by 
today’s philanthropy industry, particularly the distrust issue between donors and organisations, Gianni hopes to 
form a concept model that will make charitable foundations more transparent, faster and more efficient. Gianni 
told his father: ‘Those who urgently need help are struggling to reach those who are willing to help, especially 
during the pandemic, where in-person charity events are not possible.’ Therefore, he  launched  the 
‘LuckyFortuneDog’ project, named after the two stray dogs that he adopted last year, developing a platform that 
facilitates the connection between prospective donors and people in need. Gianni condensates the project into his 
motto: ‘ Wherever love is, there is fortune and prosperity.’ 

Why 1 trillion of total supply? 
Inspired by the business magnate, Mr Musk ‘s statement in April, 2021, Gianni asked his father if there was a 
chance to send his stray dogs or their offspring to Mars in Mr Musk’s spaceship. He knew that there was very little 
hope for this dream to come true, like one in a trillion. His father told him to hold on with this faith and to keep 
working on it, despite the one in a trillion chance.  Thus, he decided to create 1 trillion LFD tokens, representing one 
in a trillion chance. The boy believes that with a collective effort from all caring people, the world will become a 
place where everyone can share borderless and endless love.

How does LFD achieve consensus?
LFD uses a unique and efficient consensus burning mechanism Proof-of-Stake (Proof of Stake), called public charity 
voting.  It is designed to allow people with LFD balances to choose any representatives they want to vote on behalf 
of the community without having to control their funds. The decentralized holders of LFD can decide who will 
generate social consensus instead of mining companies, which makes it easy to redistribute voting weight on a 
global scale. The voting process is very effective and is an important part of the free use of LFD and the destruction 
of tokens.

LFD PARTNERSHIP WITH BINANCE
LFD is actively working on Binance Smart Chain. Down below we will answer the question: Why does the LFD use the Binance Smart Chain contract?
BSC is a better solution than Binance Chain in terms of function, speed, and versatility. It has interoperability features with new generation solutions such as passive income in the Defi world, it also stands out with the high transaction fees, intensive use of Ethereum, and the slow operation of the ETH 2.0 process.
BSC offers high-speed transactions and lower fees with a 5 second block generation time. This means your FAR transfers are being confirmed rapidly.
Here are the advantages which FAR gets from being on Binance Smart Chain :
• EVM compatibility (supporting software, applications, and software tools in Ethereum). 
• A high-performance function that can generate one block every 3 seconds 
• Supports Cross-chain Defi transfers 
• The advantage of being supported by the Binance ecosystem • Advanced security and safety

How will LFD promote the token economy?
The total issuance of LFD is 1 trillion. LFD is a simple transaction token. Two simple public welfare mechanisms will occur in each transaction: Passive income distribution: 4% of each transaction is provided as a static reward to all holders By. LP liquidity fund pool: 1% of each transaction is automatically locked to increase liquidity of funds.
The user can also deposit the purchased LFD tokens into the wallet. Get more LFD when other users are trading, so that the tokens in circulation will be rewarded regularly.
